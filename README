This is the repository for gertSVM, my parallel implimentation of the svm training method using the conjugate gradient method as described by Wen, Edelman, and Gorsich (2001).

The repositories are divided as follows:

	Serial -- the serial implementation of the training method.

	TwoSidedComm -- a simple parallel implementation using two sided communications.

	OneSidedComm -- the same parallel implementation but with RMA.

	Reduced -- an improved parallel implementation with training spread out better.

	TreeReduction -- the final adaption to the code, using a tree reduction.
